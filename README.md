# D3-Challenge

For this challenge I was hired by a major metro newspaper and tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.<br>
The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.<br>
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.<br>

To complete this task I used D3 to create a scatter chart to show the health and economic data provided with the assignment. Each axis on the chart consists of three interchangeable variables that a user can select to populate the data for that variable.
